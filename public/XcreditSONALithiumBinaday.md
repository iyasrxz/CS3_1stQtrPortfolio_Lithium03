<p>During SONA 2025, President Ferdinand "Bongbong"  Marcos Jr. discussed topics on agriculture, social services, education, and poverty. His promises make the Filipinos hope for a better future with more opportunities and improvements for the country. It was really interesting to know that some of the issues that I experience too might get resolved. I was really glad to see improvements in public transportation, especially in MRT because without MRT it would be really difficult for me to go to school. He also discussed things that students really need – learning materials, ARAL program, free college, counseling for mental health. These can help and motivate students to study and finish their education. <br><br>
Even though he promised to implement a lot of things, I wonder how much of it will truly happen. His projects are great but I think they were  “Too good to be true”. It would be really hard to implement everything during his presidential reign because it would take too much time. For example, opening more extensions in MRT – this has been delayed a lot of times because of funding shortfalls, ongoing route realignments and more. That's why I believe that being responsible is the most important thing. It's not enough to just hear about what you want to do; you have to make sure that you do them.</p>
