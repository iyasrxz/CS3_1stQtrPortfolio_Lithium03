# Q1 End of Lessons Reflections

#### by BINADAY, Aliya Louise, 9-Lithium 

#### List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.


1. Javascript Operators - It was easy to understand and use them to solve coding problems because they are a lot like operators in C++ and other programming languages. Ma'am also dicussed each operator briefly for us to recall the use of each operators.

2. Javascript Basic Statements - They are simple and are used a lot in exercises, so they are easy for me to understand. The exercises and materials in khub are actually really useful because I can recall these basic statements easily.

3. Javascript If-Else Statements - I am already familiar with this topic because we also had this during CS2 last school year. Also, because we worked through different examples where we had to test values and then perform action only when specific conditions were met, I feel comfortable applying if-else statements. 


4. Javascript Switch Statements - The code can be made simpler and easier to understand by using a switch in place of numerous if-else if conditions. After practicing during the 5th graded exercise, I felt more comfortable with switch statements.


5. HTML Basic Structure - Because HTML has a clear structure and I've used it to create basic webpages, this topic was simple to learn. There are also a lot of guides online that really helped me understand it more.

#### List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why. The why should be per topic listed.  

1. Commonly Used JavaScript Number Objects - We practiced using them to solve simple coding problems like formatting decimals and generating random numbers, so I know how they work. However, I forget their exact usage at times. So I think I need more exercises to apply them in solving real problems.

2. For Loops - I understand that for loops are often used when the number of times we wish to repeat an action is known. I still need to work on applying them to the actual coding problem, though, as I still struggle to figure out how to write code due to a lack of mastery. Also,  I sometimes lose my understanding of where the loop begins and ends.

3. While Loops - I know that while loops are helpful when we wish to keep executing till a condition is false and the number of repetitions is unknown beforehand. I can therefore understand the basic concept, but I sometimes find it difficult to construct while loops that do not result in infinite loops. To feel comfortable in developing the right conditions and managing the loop flow, I need to practice more.

4. Do While Loops - The do while loop is similar to the while loop, though it runs the code block at least once before testing the condition. Although I know how it works, I often forget cases in which a do while loop is more effective than a while loop. I need more skill identifying the right conditions to use this kind of loop efficiently.

5. Nested Loops - Loops inside loops, or nested loops, are often used for more challenging processes such as working with multidimensional arrays or generating tables.  Although I can understand the basic concept, I struggle to remember the inner and outer loop variables.  As a result, I find it difficult to understand how the program works and what outcomes it generates.  To completely understand nested loops and prevent logical errors, I need more practice.

#### Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

I am going to develop a study schedule which focuses on consistently solving coding tasks in order to gain a deeper understanding of the subjects where I still need more practice. I aim to try developing basic applications with JavaScript Number Objects until I feel more at ease using them. I'll practice with for, while, and do while loops to see how they work. I plan to start by watching tutorials, getting advice from others, and practicing using online compilers or coding platforms like W3Schools to improve my comprehension of nested loops. I will be more capable of carrying out these ideas and developing my confidence in applying them to actual tasks if I do this frequently.

#### In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
#### Effective Activities

1. In-class hands-on coding tasks were really helpful since they made it possible for me to put what I had learned into practice right away.

2. The Kahoot game activities during class were really fun and at the same time we were able to learn more about the lesson because Ma'am explains why it was the answer. It was a really great feeling when I was able to place in the Kahoot podium.

#### Not Effective Activities

1. Lengthy lectures lacking of demonstrations were less successful
since it was difficult to get an idea of how the code should work without seeing it.

2. Reading slides without interactive practice did not help much since programming is best learned by actually coding.
